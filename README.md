# Insurance CLTV Prediction

In this project, I developed a customer lifetime value (CLTV) prediction model for an insurance company using linear regression.

The dataset, Vahan_Bima.csv, includes customer demographics, policy details, and claim information.

The workflow involves data preprocessing, feature encoding, model training, and evaluation using the RÂ² score to measure the model's performance in predicting the long-term value of policyholders.
